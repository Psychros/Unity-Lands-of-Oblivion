# Unity-Lands-of-Oblivion
Aground on a lost island. This scenario can be found in numerous movies and videogames but this game is different. In this strategy building game you need to create a full functioning society on an abandoned island. That's not new but you're not god, floating above your characters...you are one of these characters in first person sight. So in the beginning you can't tell a subject to collect wood, you need to do it by yourself to build buildings like a stock or even houses for your subjects.
Lands of Oblivion is a mixture of The Forest, Minecraft and Age of Empires/Mythology but redeveloped from scratch.

This is the second try to develop this game. The previous try can be found under this link: https://github.com/lord349123/Lands-of-Oblivion
